# Async JS Example

- Copy the https URL from the repo
- Once you are in your development folder in a terminal, run `git clone` followed by the URL you copied from your forked copy of this github repository
- In VSCode, select `File` in the top right, and select `Open Folder` then find the folder you cloned named `deploy-apps-lesson` and open it, **OR**
- Alternatively you can run in the terminal `cd async-api-example` and run `code -a .` to directly open the folder in the window or `code .` to open in a new window

***Happy Coding!***
